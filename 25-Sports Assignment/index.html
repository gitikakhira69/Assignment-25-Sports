            <h2><a href="#">FOCUS</a></h2>
            <p>Virat Kohli, unlike many other batsmen, has such a voracious appetite for runs, that it does not matter which format he is playing in. The second innings essay in the first Test against the England cricket team at Rajkot was by any yardstick a phenomenal exhibition of a batsman at the top of his craft.continues to score heavily, hit centuries and win or save matches for his team, he will soon become part of cricketing folklore. </p>
